      <description>Postdoctoral Scholar Computing and Mathematical Sciences Caltech
About I am Postdoctoral Scholar at Caltech hosted by Venkat Chandrasekaran and Joel Tropp. I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics from Cornell University advised by Damek Davis. Before Cornell, I completed my MSc in Mathematics and two BS in Mathematics, and Systems and Computing Engineering at Los Andes University. There I was co-advised by Mauricio Junca and Mauricio Velasco. I spent the Fall of 2020 with the Algorithms and Optimization team at Google Research, hosted by Miles Lubin and David Applegate.</description>
