The course was delivered in Spanish. If you are interested in this subject, I strongly recommend the free video lectures on High-Dimensional Probability by, the great, Roman Vershynin. En este minicurso los asistentes tendrán la oportunidad de profundizar en el estudio de desigualdades de concentración clásicas y contemporáneas. A lo largo de tres sesiones, exploraremos desigualdades reconocidas, como las de Markov y Hoeffding, así como desigualdades más generales aplicables a variables aleatorias subgaussianas y subexponenciales. Además, se abordarán las versiones matriciales equivalentes de algunas de estas desigualdades. La teoría del curso será ilustrada con aplicaciones modernas, tales como el modelo de bloques estocásticos y reducción de dimensión, permitiendo así a los participantes adquirir habilidades aplicables en campos tan variados como la ciencia de datos, la teoría de redes y más. A través de una mezcla equilibrada de teoría y práctica, los estudiantes estarán preparados para utilizar estas poderosas herramientas en su trabajo e investigación futura, desarrollando un entendimiento sólido y aplicable de las desigualdades de concentración.\nEl curso está basado en el maravilloso libro de Roman Vershynin, \u0026ldquo;High-dimensional probability.\u0026rdquo; Pueden encontrar una copia gratuita aquí.

Grading system # We will use an ingenious grading scheme invented by Ben Grimmer for one of the previous iterations of this class. Course grades will be based on four components: Homework, Midterm, Final, Participation. These are described individually below. I will maximize the course score that I give each of you. To optimize each student\u0026rsquo;s course score, I will solve the following optimization problem.\nDenote the student’s performance in each of these four components as\n\\[ \\begin{array}{rl} C_H \u0026amp;= \\text{Homework score},\\\\ C_M \u0026amp;= \\text{Midterm score},\\\\ C_F \u0026amp;= \\text{Final score, and}\\\\ C_P \u0026amp;= \\text{Participation score}. \\end{array}\\] All of the above are scores out of \\(100\\). The optimization problem will be solved individually for each student to give them the best rubric and highest course score I can justify. Then, a rubric for grading this student is given by selecting weights for these four components as \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} H \u0026amp;= \\text{Homework weight}, \\\\ M \u0026amp;= \\text{Midterm exam weight}, \\\\ F \u0026amp;= \\text{Final exam weight}, \\\\ P \u0026amp;= 100 - H - M - F. \\end{array}\\] Notice the participation weight is determined by the other three since they must sum to 100. Each student’s score is given by maximizing over the set of all reasonable rubrics \\((H, M, F)\\) by solving \\[\\begin{array}{rl} \\text{max} \u0026amp; C_H H + C_M M + C_F F + C_P (100 - H - M - F)\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\\\\ \\text{subject to} \u0026amp; \\\\ \u0026amp; \\begin{array}{rllll} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (H, M, F) \u0026amp;\\in \\mathbb{R}^3\u0026amp;\\\\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; H + M + F \u0026amp;\\leq 100 \u0026amp;\\text{(Percentages are at most 100)}\\\\ 15 \u0026amp;\\leq\u0026amp; H, M \u0026amp; \u0026amp;\\text{(Homework and Midterm matter)}\\\\ M \u0026amp;\\leq\u0026amp; F \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\\text{(Final is more important than Midterm)}\\\\ 50 \u0026amp; \\leq\u0026amp; M + F \u0026amp; \\leq 80 \u0026amp; \\text{(Exams are most, but not all of the score)}\\\\ 90 \u0026amp; \\leq\u0026amp; H + M + F \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{(H, M, and F are the majority of the score)}. \\end{array} \\end{array}\\]\nMidterm and Final # Additional assessment will be based on one midterm exam and the final exam, both will be take home. The dates of the midterm and final exams will be posted on the course Canvas as they become available, although the date of the final exam is determined by the official JHU final exam schedule. The Midterm will be made available on Canvas on Friday October 13, 2023 and will be due at the beginning of class on Tuesday, October 17, 2023. The Final Exam will be made available on Canvas on Wednesday, December 13 and due by midnight on Friday, December 15.\nParticipation # The grading program described above will assign between 0 and 10 percent of the course to be a participation grade. As a result, you can get full marks in the course without any participation. Students will receive full points in participation for doing any of: scribing lectures, engaging during lectures, engaging in office hours, or asking insightful questions.\nScribing # Scribing at least one lecture is strongly encouraged. As mentioned above, scribing counts towards participation. Given that we have more lectures than students, there might be at most two scribes per lecture. Please send me your notes within one week of the lecture. I expect the notes to be fairly polished, and I might ask to improve them before I upload them to the website. Whenever possible, please add figures that clarify concepts and ideas. I recommend using GeoGebra, or Grapher (if you use macOS). Also, we all make mistakes, so run the notes by a grammar checker, e.g., Microsoft Word or Grammarly.\nHere is a latex template for the lecture notes\n","date":null,"permalink":"/nonlinear-fa23/","section":"Mateo Díaz","summary":"","title":"Nonlinear Optimization I - 553.761 (Fall 2023)"},{"content":" This course considers algorithms for solving various important nonlinear optimization problems and, in parallel, develops the supporting theory.

Building on the foundational concepts introduced in Probability Theory I, this course delves into more complex topics such as martingales, Markov chains, Brownian motion, and stochastic calculus. Through rigorous mathematical proofs and problem-solving exercises, students will explore the interplay between theory and application, gaining insights into how probability theory informs various fields such as finance, physics, and statistics. The course aims to equip students with a solid theoretical background and analytical skills necessary for research and application in their respective disciplines.\nCoordinates # Time: MW 1:30PM - 2:45PM Location: Maryland 217\nPersonnel # Instructor:\nMateo Díaz (mateodd at jhu dot edu) OH M 3:00PM - 5:00PM Wyman S429 New OH W 3:00PM - 5:00PM Wyman S429\nTeaching Assistant:\nAo Sun (asun17 at jhu dot edu) OH F 9:00AM - 11:00AM Wyman S425\nSyllabus # The syllabus can be found here.\nLecture notes # Handwritten lecture notes will be posted here and on Canvas.\nLecture 1: Logistics and motivation Lecture 2: Characteristic functions and Levy\u0026rsquo;s inversion formula Lecture 3: Weak convergence and Levy\u0026rsquo;s Convergence Theorem Lecture 4: Poisson distribution and the Law of Rare Events Demo Lecture 5: Conditional Expectation Lecture 6: Properties of the Conditional Expectation Lecture 7: Martingales Lecture 8: Doob\u0026rsquo;s Optional Stopping and Convergence Theorems Lecture 9: Examples: Random Walks and Branching Process Lecture 10: Convergence in Lp Lecture 11: Uniform integrability and Convergence in L1 Lecture 12: Optional stopping via UI and Backwards martingales Lecture 13: Examples: Ballot Theorem, Strong Law of Large Numbers, and de Finetti\u0026rsquo;s Theorem Lecture 14: Markov Chains Lecture 15: Markov Property Lecture 16: Strong Markov Property Lecture 17: Recurrence and Transience Lecture 18: Stationary measures Lecture 19: Aperiodicity and convergence Lecture 20: Brownian motion Lecture 21: Existence of Brownian motion Lecture 22: The Markov Property for Brownian motion Lecture 23: The Strong Markov Property for Brownian motion Lecture 24: Brownian motion as a martingale Textbook # We will use the following references:\n(Main textbook) Rick Durrett, Probability: Theory and Examples, 5th edition.

Students can work in groups of two or three people. The final project includes two deliverables: a written report and a one-hour presentation. Topics for the final project will be released two weeks before the end of class (students are welcome to pick a different project provided the approval of the instructor). Each group can choose how to split the time among the group members. The group should aim to state one result/idea, place it in context (why is it interesting? What implications does it have? Does it open interesting new research directions?), and present the main idea of its proof.\nFinal project description\nParticipation # Participation weights 10% in the final grade.
