The course was delivered in Spanish. If you are interested in this subject, I strongly recommend the free video lectures on High-Dimensional Probability by, the great, Roman Vershynin. En este minicurso los asistentes tendrán la oportunidad de profundizar en el estudio de desigualdades de concentración clásicas y contemporáneas. A lo largo de tres sesiones, exploraremos desigualdades reconocidas, como las de Markov y Hoeffding, así como desigualdades más generales aplicables a variables aleatorias subgaussianas y subexponenciales. Además, se abordarán las versiones matriciales equivalentes de algunas de estas desigualdades. La teoría del curso será ilustrada con aplicaciones modernas, tales como el modelo de bloques estocásticos y reducción de dimensión, permitiendo así a los participantes adquirir habilidades aplicables en campos tan variados como la ciencia de datos, la teoría de redes y más. A través de una mezcla equilibrada de teoría y práctica, los estudiantes estarán preparados para utilizar estas poderosas herramientas en su trabajo e investigación futura, desarrollando un entendimiento sólido y aplicable de las desigualdades de concentración.\nEl curso está basado en el maravilloso libro de Roman Vershynin, \u0026ldquo;High-dimensional probability.\u0026rdquo; Pueden encontrar una copia gratuita aquí.

Some homework assignments include at least one question that involves the writing and testing of code; Python is prefered. Please submit homework assignments on Gradescope.\nGeneral policies. Your solutions must be written legibly and intelligibly in clear English. Use complete sentences. Points may be taken off for disorganized or illegible work. Collaboration is welcome, but your writeup must be your own\u0026mdash;do not copy answers from somebody else. Indicate at the top of your homework who you collaborated with on the assignment.

The use of large language models (LLMs) for brainstorming, coding assistance, and text polishing is permitted. What is not permitted is blindly answering your assignments or Midterm with LLMs. We reserve the right to run your submissions through https://gptzero.me/ and if it outputs a probability greater than 90% of being AI-generated, you may be required to take an oral examination to defend your work.

Students may work individually or in groups of up to four, and the sole deliverable is a written report. Suggested topics will be released two weeks before the end of class, though students are welcome to propose their own with instructor approval. Reports should be written in the style of lecture notes if the topic is well established, or as a short research paper if the topic concerns current work. In either case, the report should state one main result or idea, explain why it is interesting and what implications it has (including potential new research directions), and present its proof—or a sketch thereof if the full argument is too long.\nParticipation #Participation weights 10% in the final grade.

Design a Cyanocitta cristata (Blue jay) using one square piece of paper. Just as with the previous challenge, your figure must incorporate a \u0026ldquo;color change\u0026rdquo; (white and blue). Design a \u0026ldquo;3D shadow\u0026rdquo; of a 4D hypercube (you can use modular origami). Design an origami modular for three intersecting golden rectangles. Design an origami tesselation (one square pice of paper) of at least two regular tessellations of the plane (one has to use hexagons). Design origami modulars for at least two of the Platonic solids. Design an origami modular of a polyhedral stellation. Resources # Useful websites CFC Origami Gilad\u0026rsquo;s Origami Page Origami Shop What paper to use? Simple figures: any paper.

To optimize each student\u0026rsquo;s course score, I will solve the following optimization problem.\nDenote the student’s performance in each of these four components as\n\\[ \\begin{array}{rl} C_H \u0026amp;= \\text{Homework score},\\\\ C_M \u0026amp;= \\text{Midterm score},\\\\ C_F \u0026amp;= \\text{Final score, and}\\\\ C_P \u0026amp;= \\text{Participation score}. \\end{array}\\] All of the above are scores out of \\(100\\). The optimization problem will be solved individually for each student to give them the best rubric and highest course score I can justify. Then, a rubric for grading this student is given by selecting weights for these four components as \\[ \\begin{array}{rl} H \u0026amp;= \\text{Homework weight}, \\\\ M \u0026amp;= \\text{Midterm exam weight}, \\\\ F \u0026amp;= \\text{Final exam weight}, \\\\ P \u0026amp;= 100 - H - M - F. \\end{array}\\] Notice the participation weight is determined by the other three since they must sum to 100. Each student’s score is given by maximizing over the set of all reasonable rubrics \\((H, M, F)\\) by solving \\[\\begin{array}{rl} \\text{max} \u0026amp; C_H H + C_M M + C_F F + C_P (100 - H - M - F)\u0026amp;\u0026amp;\\\\ \\text{subject to} \u0026amp; \\\\ \u0026amp; \\begin{array}{rllll} \u0026amp;\u0026amp; (H, M, F) \u0026amp;\\in \\mathbb{R}^3\u0026amp;\\\\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; H + M + F \u0026amp;\\leq 100 \u0026amp;\\text{(Percentages are at most 100)}\\\\ 15 \u0026amp;\\leq\u0026amp; H, M \u0026amp; \u0026amp;\\text{(Homework and Midterm matter)}\\\\ M \u0026amp;\\leq\u0026amp; F \u0026amp;\u0026amp;\\text{(Final is more important than Midterm)}\\\\ 50 \u0026amp; \\leq\u0026amp; M + F \u0026amp; \\leq 80 \u0026amp; \\text{(Exams are most, but not all of the score)}\\\\ 90 \u0026amp; \\leq\u0026amp; H + M + F \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\text{(H, M, and F are the majority of the score)}. \\end{array} \\end{array}\\]\nMidterm and Final #Additional assessment will be based on one midterm exam and the final exam, both will be take home.

The Final Exam will be made available on Canvas on Wednesday, December 13 and due by midnight on Friday, December 15.\nParticipation #The grading program described above will assign between 0 and 10 percent of the course to be a participation grade.

Students will receive full points in participation for doing any of: scribing lectures, engaging during lectures, engaging in office hours, or asking insightful questions.\nScribing #Scribing at least one lecture is strongly encouraged. As mentioned above, scribing counts towards participation. Given that we have more lectures than students, there might be at most two scribes per lecture. Please send me your notes within one week of the lecture. I expect the notes to be fairly polished, and I might ask to improve them before I upload them to the website.
